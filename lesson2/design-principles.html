                    This screenshot from the local business, Farmington Service & Towing effecitvely utilizes the principle of Visual Hierarchy. When the page is loaded, the bright and bold words "Auto Repai & 24 Hour Towing" tell you exactly what kinds of services the business specializes in. They also include a "Schedule and Appointment" button right next to the top tier of the visual hierarchy. This button is in a bright red box and is the next tier of the hierarchy. After this, the business logo as well as a navigation bar are the next tier that help customer find other information if needed.

                    This screenshot is also from a local business here in Utah. Flights From Home is a service that find the cheapest flights all over the world that are departing from Salt Lake City, Utah. My wife and I love to travel and this has been a great to find good deals. On the mobile version of the website, the principle of Alignment is portrayed well and very clearly in the center-aligned text throughout the page. They keep the first screen you see very clean and simple and the alightment helps to see exactly where you should be looking as a consumer.

                    This last screenshot is from the music streaming service, Spotify. This was one website I tried to use from my browser, but it always just redirected me to my Spotify App or to the App Store. The plinciple that is shown in this screenshot is Contrast. Here you can see two colors that are on opposite sides of the color wheel. Becuase of this, the colors contrast well. Despite being both very bright colors, the text is clear and easy to read and portrays a certain mood that goes along with music.
