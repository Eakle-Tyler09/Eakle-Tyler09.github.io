            <p>
                The target audience for this website can be quite wide as long as the individual is planning on skiing or snowboarding within the next week. Age is likely to vary greatly, although the most likely visiotor to the websitewill be between 18-50. The income of those coming to the website is also most likely to be a middle or upper class income, due to the nature of the cost of winter sports. Education plays a small part when factored into the most plausible demographic. both highly educated and uneducated people are known to enjoy winter sports. Experience with the topic is likely to be a big factor in website visitor demographics. More experienced winter sports enthusiasts are likely to check the weather, while inexperienced skiiers and snowboarders may not think to check the weather.

                Personas: Chad & Doug
            </h3>
            <p>
                Chad is a good respresentation of a typical visitor to the FindTheSnow website. Chad is 22 years old. Chad has been snowboarding since he was 3 years old and knows the slopes of Utah like the back of his hand. He is tech savvy, and knows with a quick visit to FindTheSnow.com, he can guarantee a radical day in the mountains. This is important to Chad. He is in school and tries to get to the mountains as often as he can, sometimes procrastinating school work in order to do so. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Doug is also a common visitor to the FindTheSnow website. Doug is a 42 year old father who loves taking his family out for a day in the mountains. Like Chad, Doug grew up skiing and has a passion for it. Despite this, his work only allows him to go a couple of times per year, if that. BEcause of this, Doug, being the well prepared man he is, makes sure he gets optimal powder on his ski days.
